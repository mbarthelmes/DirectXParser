# DirectXParser
This was made for my DirectX11 project I am doing in my Advanced Graphics class.
The purpose of this console application is to convert .obj files to .txt files for my project to be able to load 3D objects.
This is how the code works at the moment:
- There are two strings that determine the file path of the .obj file and the new .txt file.
- Takes vertex, texture, and normal coordinates and puts them into arrays.
- Assigns the coordinates to the correct vertices. These will be printed in the console and be saved onto the .txt file.
I may choose to add more features later to allow you to choose files from the app itself.
